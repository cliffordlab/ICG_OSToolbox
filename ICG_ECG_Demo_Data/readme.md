# ICG ECG Data for Demonstration 
  
    Data for demonstration of "Open source noise removal toolbox for ICG signal".
  
## ECG_ICG_Data

Synchronized ECG and ICG signals in physically rest condition under different psychological conditions recorded using impedance and electrocardiography equipment from BIOPAC (BIOPAC Systems Inc., Goleta, CA).
    - ECG 
      - Sampling frequency:  1000
      -  Physical units:  mV
     - ICG

      - Physical units:  Ohm/s
  
  ## Ensemble_Averaged_ECG_ICG
  
    Noise free three-stage ensmeble averaged (EA) ECG ICG data generated from "ECG_ICG_Data" using noise removal algorithm.
  
  ## Sample_Annoatations_by_ICMAA
  
    Annotation of Noise free EA ECG ICG data from folder "Ensemble_Averaged_ECG_ICG" using ICMAA.
  
  ## Sample_Parameters_Extracted
  
    Parameters extracted using EA ICG from "Ensemble_Averaged_ECG_ICG" and annotations from "Sample_Annoatations_by_ICMAA".
